# Coding Bootcamp Prework Study Guide

## Description

This application is a study guide that summarizes the lessons learned during the prework phase of the WashU Coding Bootcamp. I built this application to aid fellow students in the future in their endeavors to learn to code as well as to practice and display the various techniques learned during the prework process. This puts all the important information in one place rather than forcing students to review all over the various prework modules. During this construction, I learned a variety of basic techniques from four major facets of coding: HTML, CSS, JS, and Git.

## Installation
N/A

## Usage
To use this application, review the notes as added by the developers regarding each section and consider how these notes are implemented in the application's code. To view the JavaScript coding, right click anywhere on the study guide and open the "inspect" tab to view the JavaScript code at work. This will list the various coding subsections we studied and provide a randomly-assigned starting spot.
